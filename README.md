# NFT Website

This website was specifically designed to ease the common confusion around NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). NFTs are one of the most misinterpreted topics on cryptocurrency and can be quite confusing to understand. After leaving this website, I hope to have made your overall understanding of NFTs to be much more advanced, and to possibly interest you in buying your first NFT. Check out our NFT explanation if you want to know what NFTs are, or our FAQ page for a summed up version of NFTs.
